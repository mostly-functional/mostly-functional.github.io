<h1 class="title">Computer Architecture</h1>
<div class="content ">
  <p>While having a deep understanding of computer hardware and operating systems is not vital to most roles, having at least a superficial understanding is important for understanding many other concepts.
In this section, we provide a overview of some of the hardware and operating system concepts most relevant to application development (and the rest of this document).
The material is pretty fundamental, and anybody working in tech should be somewhat familiar with it.</p>
<h2 id="digital-electronics">Digital Electronics</h2>
<p>TODO: integrated circuits, logic gates, hardware, software</p>
<h2 id="binary">Binary</h2>
<p>All hardware devices operate on sequences of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit"><em>bits</em></a> (a bit is a single base-2 number), usually organized into chunks of 8 called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte"><em>bytes</em></a>.
Data stored as bits is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code"><em>binary</em></a> (often written as a sequence of <code>1</code>s and <code>0</code>s, prefixed with <code>0b</code>; e.g. <code>0b10110011</code>).
Binary data is commonly displayed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal (hex)</a> form (base-16 numbers; displayed using <code>0-9</code> followed by <code>A-F</code> or <code>a-f</code>; often prefixed with <code>0x</code>; e.g. <code>0xF12A</code>).
One byte is two hexadecimal characters (e.g. <code>0b11011100 = 0xFC</code>).</p>
<h2 id="cpus">CPUs</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">central processing unit (CPU)</a> (often called just &lsquo;processor&rsquo;) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a> that executes the instructions that make up programs.</p>
<p>Any given CPU model understands a specific set of instructions, called its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture"><em>instruction set</em></a>.
There are lots of instruction set architectures, but in practice the only two that matter are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86">x86</a> (which is what the CPU in your computer uses) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a> (which is what the CPUs in your phone and tablet use).</p>
<p>The frequency at which a processor executes its instructions is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate"><em>clock rate</em></a>.
Advancements in computing power used to be driven by ever increasing CPU clock rates, but this increase has plateaued in recent years (due to physical limits).</p>
<p>These days, processors typically have a variable clock rate that maxes out somewhere in the 2-5 GHz range, and advancement in CPU computing power happens by squeezing more <em>cores</em> (processing units that can run independently of one another) onto the CPU chip.
This increase in cores can only be utilized by software that&rsquo;s been explicitly written to run using multiple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)"><em>threads</em></a>.</p>
<h2 id="memory-and-disk">Memory and Disk</h2>
<p>Computers store data in two places: in <em>memory</em> (using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">random access memory (RAM)</a> chips) and on <em>disk</em> (using some form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage">data storage</a>, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive">hard disk drives (HDDs)</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive">solid state drives (SSDs)</a>).</p>
<p>Memory is volatile (it is erased when the computer is turned off), while disk storage is permanent, so disk is used for any data that needs to be stored long-term.
On the other hand, writing to and reading from memory is much faster than to/from disk, so running applications tend to keep the data they need to operate in memory.</p>
<p>Personal devices usually have up to 32 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte">GB</a> of memory and up to 1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terabyte">TB</a> of disk, while servers can have up to multiple TBs of memory and hundreds of TBs of disk.</p>
<p>TODO: partitions, RAID (?)</p>
<h2 id="other-components">Other Components</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">graphics processing unit (GPU)</a> is a computer component primarily used to perform graphics-related computations.
GPUs are built for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_parallelism">data parallelism</a> (performing one operation on many pieces of data at the same time) and typically have thousands of cores.
Because of this, lately they&rsquo;re increasingly being used for non-graphics-related tasks involving high data parallelism, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator#Use_of_GPU">training machine learning models</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network#Mining">mining Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard">motherboard</a> is the component into which all the aforementioned components plug in, together with keyboards, USB devices, etc.</p>
<h2 id="encodings-and-compression">Encodings and Compression</h2>
<p>Since hardware operates on binary data, this means that any data that&rsquo;s not binary by nature (e.g. text, audio, images, etc.) must be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"><em>encoded</em></a> to binary before it can be processed or stored.</p>
<p>For text, this happens via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding"><em>character encoding</em></a>.
There are several character encodings in common use, but the most popular these days is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a> (one of the encodings specified as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> standard).
UTF-8 is designed to be backwards-compatible with the older and much more limited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> standard (which is common in older systems, but which can&rsquo;t encode most alphabets).</p>
<p>Embedding binary data where text is more convenient is usually done using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-to-text_encoding">binary-to-text encoding</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64</a> (base-64 numbers; displayed using <code>A-Z</code>, followed by <code>a-z</code>, followed by <code>0-9</code>, usually followed by <code>+</code> and <code>/</code>).</p>
<p>Non-textual data is typically stored using specialized encodings (like for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_coding_format">audio</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_coding_format">video</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_file_formats">images</a>).
These encodings typically employ some form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression"><em>data compression</em></a> in order to reduce the file size.
Data compression methods can either be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_compression">lossless</a> (i.e. no information is lost when encoding the data) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression">lossy</a> (i.e. the encoding process throws away some information present in the data in order to reduce file size).
Most media you&rsquo;ll encounter (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">JPEG</a> images or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3">MP3</a> audio) uses lossy compression.</p>
<p>Another area where lossless compression is used is for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive_file#Archive_formats"><em>archive files</em></a>.
These are files that bundle together multiple files and directories (together with some metadata) and then compress them.
Common such formats include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)">ZIP</a> (typically associated with the filename extension <code>.zip</code>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)">tar</a> (typically associated with the filename extensions <code>.tar</code>, <code>.tar.gz</code>, <code>.tgz</code>, <code>.tar.xz</code>, and <code>.txz</code>, depending on which method of compression is used).</p>
