<h1 class="title">Computer Architecture and Operating Systems</h1>
<div class="content ">
  <p>While having a deep understanding of computer hardware and operating systems is not vital to most roles, having at least a superficial understanding is important for understanding many other concepts.
In this section, we provide a overview of some of the hardware and operating system concepts most relevant to application development (and the rest of this document).
The material is pretty fundamental, and anybody working in tech should be somewhat familiar with it.</p>
<h2 id="cpus">CPUs</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">central processing unit (CPU)</a> (often called just &lsquo;processor&rsquo;) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">chip</a> that executes the instructions that make up programs.</p>
<p>Any given CPU model understands a specific set of instructions, called its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture"><em>instruction set</em></a>.
There are lots of instruction set architectures, but in practice the only two that matter are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86">x86</a> (which is what the CPU in your computer uses) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a> (which is what the CPUs in your phone and tablet use).</p>
<p>The frequency at which a processor executes its instructions is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate"><em>clock rate</em></a>.
Advancements in computing power used to be driven by ever increasing CPU clock rates, but this increase has plateaued in recent years (due to physical limits).</p>
<p>These days, processors typically have a variable clock rate that maxes out somewhere in the 2-5 GHz range, and advancement in CPU computing power happens by squeezing more <em>cores</em> (processing units that can run independently of one another) onto the CPU chip.
This increase in cores can only be utilized by software that&rsquo;s been explicitly written to run using multiple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)"><em>threads</em></a>.</p>
<h2 id="memory-and-disk">Memory and Disk</h2>
<p>Computers store data in two places: in <em>memory</em> (using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">random access memory (RAM)</a> chips) and on <em>disk</em> (using some form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage">data storage</a>, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive">hard disk drives (HDDs)</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive">solid state drives (SSDs)</a>).</p>
<p>Memory is volatile (it is erased when the computer is turned off), while disk storage is permanent, so disk is used for any data that needs to be stored long-term.
On the other hand, writing to and reading from memory is much faster than to/from disk, so running applications tend to keep the data they need to operate in memory.</p>
<p>Personal devices usually have up to 32 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte">GB</a> of memory and up to 1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terabyte">TB</a> of disk, while servers can have up to multiple TBs of memory and hundreds of TBs of disk.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="other-components">Other Components</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">graphics processing unit (GPU)</a> is a computer component primarily used to perform graphics-related computations.
GPUs are built for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_parallelism">data parallelism</a> (performing one operation on many pieces of data at the same time) and typically have thousands of cores.
Because of this, lately they&rsquo;re increasingly being used for non-graphics-related tasks involving high data parallelism, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator#Use_of_GPU">training machine learning models</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network#Mining">mining Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard">motherboard</a> is the component into which all the aforementioned components plug in, together with keyboards, USB devices, etc.</p>
<h2 id="binary-encodings-and-compression">Binary, Encodings and Compression</h2>
<p>All hardware devices operate on sequences of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit"><em>bits</em></a> (a bit is a single base-2 number), usually organized into chunks of 8 called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte"><em>bytes</em></a>.
Data stored as bits is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code"><em>binary</em></a> (often written as a sequence of <code>1</code>s and <code>0</code>s, prefixed with <code>0b</code>; e.g. <code>0b10110011</code>).
Binary data is commonly displayed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal (hex)</a> form (base-16 numbers; displayed using <code>0-9</code> followed by <code>A-F</code> or <code>a-f</code>; often prefixed with <code>0x</code>; e.g. <code>0xF12A</code>).
One byte is two hexadecimal characters (e.g. <code>0b11011100 = 0xFC</code>).</p>
<p>Since hardware operates on binary data, this means that any data that&rsquo;s not binary by nature (e.g. text, audio, images, etc.) must be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code"><em>encoded</em></a> to binary before it can be processed or stored.</p>
<p>For text, this happens via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding"><em>character encoding</em></a>.
There are several character encodings in common use, but the most popular these days is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a> (one of the encodings specified as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> standard).
UTF-8 is designed to be backwards-compatible with the older and much more limited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> standard (which is common in older systems, but which can&rsquo;t encode most alphabets).</p>
<p>Embedding binary data where text is more convenient is usually done using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-to-text_encoding">binary-to-text encoding</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64</a> (base-64 numbers; displayed using <code>A-Z</code>, followed by <code>a-z</code>, followed by <code>0-9</code>, usually followed by <code>+</code> and <code>/</code>).</p>
<p>Non-textual data is typically stored using specialized encodings (like for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_coding_format">audio</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_coding_format">video</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_file_formats">images</a>).
These encodings typically employ some form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression"><em>data compression</em></a> in order to reduce the file size.
Data compression methods can either be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_compression">lossless</a> (i.e. no information is lost when encoding the data) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression">lossy</a> (i.e. the encoding process throws away some information present in the data in order to reduce file size).
Most media you&rsquo;ll encounter (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">JPEG</a> images or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3">MP3</a> audio) uses lossy compression.</p>
<p>Another area where lossless compression is used is for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive_file#Archive_formats"><em>archive files</em></a>.
These are files that bundle together multiple files and directories (together with some metadata) and then compress them.
Common such formats include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)">ZIP</a> (typically associated with the filename extension <code>.zip</code>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)">tar</a> (typically associated with the filename extensions <code>.tar</code>, <code>.tar.gz</code>, <code>.tgz</code>, <code>.tar.xz</code>, and <code>.txz</code>, depending on which method of compression is used).</p>
<h2 id="operating-systems">Operating Systems</h2>
<p>The software that handles communication with and management of a computer&rsquo;s hardware is called a <a href="(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system))"><em>kernel</em></a>.
Kernel are bundled with various utilities, graphical interfaces, etc. as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"><em>Operating Systems (OSs)</em></a>.</p>
<p>The dominant OSs are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Windows</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS">macOS</a> (formerly OS X), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>.
Linux isn&rsquo;t really a single OS, but rather a family of OSs that all use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel">Linux kernel</a>.</p>
<p>Linux and macOS both belong to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">Unix</a> family of OSs.
This means that they&rsquo;re very similar from a usage and application development perspective, and any given piece of software is typically available for both.</p>
<p>Kernels provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface#Operating_systems">application programming interfaces (APIs)</a> for programmers/programs to interact with.
Calls made to these APIs are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call"><em>system calls</em></a> (or <em>syscalls</em>).</p>
<p>Kernel APIs are built around a set of abstractions, which help provide a more convenient interface than dealing directly with the underlying hardware.
The following abstractions are especially important:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)"><em>Processes</em></a>: A process is an instance of a running program. Processes can make syscalls to launch (or <em>spawn</em>) other processes — these are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_process"><em>child processes</em></a> of the original process. Each process has a unique <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_identifier"><em>Process ID</em> (PID)</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)"><em>Threads</em></a>: A thread is a sequence of instructions running independently as part of a program. Processes start with one thread, and can spawn more threads via syscalls. Used to make programs to multiple things at the same time.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file"><em>Files</em></a>: A file is a chunk of data, given a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename">filename</a> (sometimes containing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename_extension"><em>filename extension</em></a> like <code>.html</code>) and stored on disk. Files can be created, moved, deleted, and <em>opened</em> (for reading and/or writing) through syscalls.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem"><em>file system</em></a>: a big data structure into which all files on a computer are organized. In Unix, the file system is organized as a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)#Rooted_tree">rooted tree</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing)"><em>directories</em></a> (or <em>folders</em>); the top-level directory of which is called the <em>root</em> directory and denoted <code>/</code>. In Windows, the file system consists of multiple rooted trees (with root directories <code>C:</code>, <code>D:</code>, etc.). Note: Confusingly, the word &lsquo;file system&rsquo; is also used to refer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system">format used to serialize files on disk</a>.</li>
<li><em>Sockets</em>: Sockets are channels that can be opened either between processes running on the same machine (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket">Unix sockets</a>) or between hosts on different machines (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket"><em>network sockets</em></a>) for the purpose of sending data back and forth.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The following abstractions are also good to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory"><em>Virtual memory</em></a>: A chunk of memory allotted to a process to store data in. If all available memory is exhausted, the OS sometimes transparently relocates parts of the virtual memory to disk (this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging"><em>paging</em></a>, and the place where the data is stored is called a <em>swap file</em> or <em>swap partition</em>).</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable"><em>Environment variables</em></a>: A set of values, addressed by keys, used to pass configuration information to processes. Each process has an associated set of environment variables, which are usually &lsquo;passed down&rsquo; to its child processes.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)"><em>Signals</em></a>: notifications sent from the OS to a process, typically to tell it to stop running.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to be executed by the OS, a program must first be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compiled</a> (translated to machine code using the appropriate instruction set) and stored as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable">executable</a> binary file (in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface">format understood by the OS</a>).
Programs can delegate some work to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)#Shared_libraries"><em>shared libraries</em></a>, which are chunks of code written by somebody else, that have been compiled and are stored somewhere on the file system.</p>
<p>Modern OSs are <em>multi-user</em>; they have multiple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing)">user accounts</a>, often but not always associated with specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_user"><em>end users</em></a> (humans).
Each file, directory and process is <em>owned</em> by some user account (typically the account that created it), and users can not access files or directories owned by other users unless they have been granted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions"><em>permission</em></a> to do so.
There&rsquo;s also a special user called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser"><em>superuser</em></a> (also called <em>root user</em> or <em>administrator</em>), which always has permission to do whatever it wants.
OSs typically have mechanism that allow end users to execute specific commands as the superuser.</p>
<p>OSs usually ship with both a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">graphical user interface (GUI)</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">command-line interface (CLI)</a> called a [shell](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)</a>.
Most people who use computers never interact with a shell, but knowing how to use a shell well is an essential skill for power users.</p>
